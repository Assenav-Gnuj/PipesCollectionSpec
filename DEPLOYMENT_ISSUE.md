## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Docker Architecture
- **Multi-stage build**: Separate stages for dependencies, building, and runtime
- **Optimization**: Minimal runtime image with only necessary files
- **Security**: Non-root user, minimal attack surface
- **Monitoring**: Built-in health checks for all services

### Service Configuration
- **Application**: Next.js on port 3000 with health checks
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15 with persistent storage and health checks
- **Cache**: Redis 7 with memory limits and persistence
- **Storage**: MinIO S3-compatible storage for images

### Environment Management
- **Development**: Docker Compose with local volumes
- **Production**: Coolify-optimized configuration with secrets management
- **Security**: Environment variable injection, no hardcoded secrets

## üöÄ Deployment Execution Plan

### Pre-Deployment Requirements
1. **VPS Setup**:
   - Coolify installed and configured
   - Docker and Docker Compose available
   - Sufficient resources (2GB RAM minimum)

2. **DNS Configuration**:
   - A record: www.cachimbosetabacos.com.br ‚Üí VPS IP
   - Optional: CNAME for naked domain redirect

3. **Environment Preparation**:
   - Generate secure secrets (NextAuth, database passwords)
   - Prepare MinIO credentials
   - Set up admin credentials

### Deployment Steps
1. **Coolify Project Creation**:
   - Create new project: "Pipes Collection"
   - Connect Git repository
   - Configure branch: main

2. **Service Configuration**:
