# Pipes & Tobacco Collection Website Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. User-Centric Design
The website must prioritize intuitive navigation and seamless user experience. All pages must load quickly and provide clear visual hierarchy. The design must be responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. Interactive elements like ratings, comments, and search must function without user registration requirements to encourage engagement.

**Rationale**: A collection website's success depends on visitors easily finding and exploring content. Removing barriers to interaction increases community engagement and content discovery.

### II. Content Management Excellence
The administrative CMS must provide complete CRUD operations for all collection items (pipes, tobaccos, accessories). Image upload and management must support multiple photos per item with designated featured images. Content moderation tools for user comments must be built-in. All content changes must be immediately reflected on the public site without caching delays.

**Rationale**: The collection owner needs full control over their content presentation and community interactions while maintaining site quality and preventing spam.

### III. Performance & Accessibility
Page load times must not exceed 3 seconds on average connections. Images must be optimized and served in appropriate formats. The site must meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards. Search functionality must provide instant feedback and relevant results. All interactive elements must provide clear visual feedback.

**Rationale**: Fast, accessible websites reach broader audiences and provide better user experiences, essential for showcasing a curated collection.

### IV. Clean Architecture
Frontend and backend must be clearly separated with RESTful API design. Database schema must support flexible content types with proper relationships. Code must be modular with clear separation of concerns. All components must be testable in isolation.

**Rationale**: Clean architecture ensures maintainability as the collection grows and new features are added over time.

### V. Security & Privacy
User interactions must not require personal data collection beyond optional comment attribution. All form inputs must be validated and sanitized. The admin panel must use secure authentication. All data transmissions must use HTTPS. User ratings and comments must be stored securely.

**Rationale**: Protecting user privacy builds trust while securing admin access protects the collection content from unauthorized modifications.

## Technical Constraints

### Technology Stack
- Frontend: Modern web technologies (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ES6+)
- Backend: RESTful API with secure authentication
- Database: Relational database supporting complex queries and relationships
- Image Storage: Optimized storage with multiple format support
- Hosting: Production-ready deployment with SSL certificate

### Performance Standards
- First Contentful Paint: < 2 seconds
- Largest Contentful Paint: < 3 seconds
- Image optimization: WebP/AVIF format support with fallbacks
- Mobile responsiveness: Works on screens ≥ 320px width
- Search response time: < 500ms for filtered results

## Development Workflow

### Quality Gates
All features must pass visual regression testing across major browsers. Database migrations must be reversible and tested. Admin panel changes must not affect public site availability. User interaction features must degrade gracefully if JavaScript fails.

### Content Standards
All collection items must have standardized field validation. Image uploads must enforce size and format restrictions. Rating systems must prevent duplicate votes from same session. Comment moderation workflow must be clearly defined.

## Governance

This constitution defines the non-negotiable requirements for the Pipes & Tobacco Collection website. All development decisions must align with these principles. Any proposed changes that conflict with core principles require constitutional amendment through documented justification and impact analysis.

Amendment procedures require:
1. Clear documentation of proposed changes
2. Impact assessment on existing functionality
3. User experience evaluation
4. Performance impact analysis

Version control follows semantic versioning:
- MAJOR: Breaking changes to user experience or admin workflow
- MINOR: New features or significant enhancements
- PATCH: Bug fixes, performance improvements, minor content updates
