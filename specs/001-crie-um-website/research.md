### Session Management Decision
**Decision**: Redis for session storage
**Rationale**:
- Fast session lookups for rating duplicate prevention
- Persistent sessions across server restarts
- Scalable for future traffic growth

**Configuration areas**:
- Database connection strings
- Authentication providers
- Image storage credentials
- Performance tuning parameters

## Performance Optimization Research

### Image Optimization Strategy
**Decision**: Next.js Image component with WebP/AVIF conversion
**Rationale**:
- Automatic format selection based on browser support
- Lazy loading for performance
- Responsive image sizing
- CDN integration capabilities
**Implementation**:
- Multiple image sizes for responsive design
- Progressive loading for large galleries
- Thumbnail generation for listing pages

### Search Implementation
**Decision**: PostgreSQL full-text search with trigram indexing
**Rationale**:
- Built-in database search avoiding external dependencies
- Fuzzy matching for typo tolerance
- Fast performance with proper indexing
- Simple maintenance compared to Elasticsearch
**Features**:
- Cross-entity search (pipes, tobaccos, accessories)
- Brand and specification filtering
- Real-time search suggestions

### Caching Strategy
**Decision**: Next.js built-in caching with Redis enhancement
**Rationale**:
- Static page generation for public content
- API route caching for database queries
- Redis caching for expensive operations
- Automatic cache invalidation on content updates
**Implementation**:
- ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) for collection pages
- Redis cache for search results
- Browser caching with proper headers

## Development Workflow Research

### Testing Strategy
**Decision**: Jest (unit) + Playwright (E2E) + React Testing Library
**Rationale**:
- Comprehensive testing coverage for quality assurance
- Automated testing in CI/CD pipeline
- User-focused testing approach
- Simple test maintenance
**Coverage areas**:
- Component unit tests
- API endpoint testing
- User interaction flows
- Cross-browser compatibility

### Code Quality Tools
**Decision**: ESLint + Prettier + TypeScript
**Rationale**:
